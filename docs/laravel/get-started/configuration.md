# Configuration

LaraDumps configuration is stored in `config/laradumps.php` file, and some options can be configured directly in your project's `.env` file.

You can also run `php artisan ds:init` at any time to modify the settings via the wizard.

---

## Configuration options

LaraDumps options and their respective configurations are detailed in this section.

### App Host

Desktop App Host. Your Laravel project will send Dumps to this address.

You can configure the host in your `.env` file, under the key `DS_APP_HOST`.

In most cases, it will be your localhost:

```shell
DS_APP_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

You may configure a custom host value, if needed.

<style>
    td::before { display: none }
    <!-- @see https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/issues/794 -->
</style>

| **Environment**             |  **Host**            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Default                     | 127.0.0.1            |
| Docker/Sail                 | host.docker.internal |
| Homestead with VirtualBox   | 10.211.55.2          |
| Homestead with Parallels    | 10.211.55.2          |
| WSL Host                    | WSL IP (read below)  |

#### Docker and Linux

If you are using `Docker` on a `Linux` host, you must perform additional configuration because. Automatic mapping is not available. Read more [here](https://github.com/laravel/sail/pull/222).

#### WSL

If you are running your project directly from the WSL machine, you must configure LaraDumps with the WSL IP.

This is often the case when running `php artisan server` from inside the WSL machine.

The WSL IP changes every time the computer is restarted, and you must update your project configuration when the IP changes.

##### Find out the WSL IP

To determine the WSL IP address, launch Windows Powershell and execute the `ipconfig` command.

You should see an output similar to this:

```shell
C:\Users\user>ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~ some other adapters.... ~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ethernet adapter vEthernet (WSL):

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fda6::4727:7d48:8e61:7d48%60
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 172.21.48.1 <====================================
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.240.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :
```

Scroll down to the `Ethernet adapter vEthernet (WSL)` section, disregard other adapters.

Now, add the IP address from this section in your `DS_APP_HOST` in your `.env` file.

For example:

```shell
DS_APP_HOST=172.21.48.1
```

---

### App Port

The Desktop App Port. Must always be `9191`.

```shell
DS_APP_PORT=9191
```

This configuration key will be deprecated in LaraDumps V2

### Auto-Invoke

By default, LaraDumps Desktop App will be invoked and gain focus whenever a new dump arrives.

To disable this behavior, change the `.env` file key `DS_AUTO_INVOKE_APP` to `false`.

You can also send [Quiet dumps](laravel/debug/usage?id=quiet-dump) and the app will not be invoked.

```shell
DS_AUTO_INVOKE_APP=true #enabled
```

---

### SQL Queries

You must have this feature enabled to capture [SQL Queries](laravel/debug/usage?id=sql-queries) and send them to the Desktop App.

To enable this feature, change the `.env` file key `DS_SEND_QUERIES` to `true`.

```shell
DS_SEND_QUERIES=true #enabled
```

---

### Laravel Logs

You must have this feature enabled to send [Laravel Logs](laravel/debug/usage?id=laravel-logs).

To enable this feature, change the `.env` file key `DS_SEND_LOGS` to `true`.

 ```shell
DS_SEND_LOGS=true #enabled
```

---

### Livewire Components

Tracking Livewire Components can be enabled and disabled in your project's `.env` file.

```shell
DS_SEND_LIVEWIRE_COMPONENTS=true #enabled
```

---

### Livewire Protected Properties

Enables LaraDumps to access protected and private properties of Livewire components.

Configure the key `DS_LIVEWIRE_PROTECTED_PROPERTIES` in your project's `.env` file:

```shell
DS_LIVEWIRE_PROTECTED_PROPERTIES=true #enabled
```

---

### Livewire Events

When this feature is enabled, LaraDumps can track and send [Livewire Events](laravel/debug/livewire?id=livewire-events) to the Desktop App.

Configure the key `DS_LIVEWIRE_EVENTS` in your project's `.env` file:

```shell
DS_LIVEWIRE_EVENTS=true #enabled
```

---

### Livewire Browser Events

When this feature is enabled, LaraDumps will track and send [Browser Events dispatch](laravel/debug/livewire?id=livewire-events) to the Desktop App.

Configure the key `DS_LIVEWIRE_DISPATCH` in your project's `.env` file:

```shell
DS_LIVEWIRE_DISPATCH=true #enabled
```

---

### Specify Livewire Components

You can specify which Livewire Components will be tracked by the Desktop Application in your project's `.env` file.

Only components in this list will send state to the Desktop App.

```php
DS_LIVEWIRE_COMPONENTS="MyComponent,NotesComponent,AttachmentsComponent"
```

---

### Ignore Livewire Components

To ignore specific Livewire components, include each class path in the `ignore_livewire_components` key inside the config file.

Components in this list will NOT send state to the Desktop App.

```php
'ignore_livewire_components' => [
     \App\Http\Livewire\MyComponent::class,
     \App\Http\Livewire\NotesComponent::class,
],
```

---

### Livewire Validation

To enable dumping [Livewire failed validations](laravel/debug/usage?id=livewire-validation), change the key `DS_SEND_LIVEWIRE_FAILED_VALIDATION` to `true` inside your project's `.env` file.

You can also configure the interval (sleep time).

```shell
DS_SEND_LIVEWIRE_FAILED_VALIDATION=true #enabled
DS_SEND_LIVEWIRE_FAILED_VALIDATION_SLEEP=400 #milliseconds
```

---

### Livewire Auto-Clear

When debugging Livewire, you need to clear your LaraDumps APP history every time the page is reloaded to keep track of your components.

LaraDumps can automatically clear the screen on page reload. You must include the Auto-Clean Blade directive together with the Livewire directive.

```html
  <!-- Scripts -->
    @livewireScripts
    @if(app()->environment('local'))
        @dsAutoClearOnPageReload
    @endif
</body>
```

This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, change the configuration key `auto_clear_on_page_reload` to `true`.

```php
'auto_clear_on_page_reload' = true, //enabled
```

---

## Livewire Component Highlight

When this feature is enabled, LaraDumps can [Highlight Livewire Components](laravel/debug/livewire?id=livewire-component-highlight) in your browser when they are selected in Desktop App.

Configure the key `DS_LIVEWIRE_COMPONENTS_HIGHLIGHT` in your project's `.env` file:

```shell
DS_LIVEWIRE_COMPONENTS_HIGHLIGHT=true #enabled
```

---

### Routes

You might want to skip some routes when dumping [Routes](laravel/debug/usage?id=routes).

Append the routes to be ignored under the `ignore_route_contains` configuration key.

By default, these routes are ignored:

```php
'ignore_route_contains' => [
    'debugbar',
    'ignition',
    'horizon',
    'livewire',
    'my-secret-route', // this route will be skipped
],
```

---

### Preferred IDE

Each dump contains a link to the file and line where the `ds()` was called from.

You may configure your preferred IDE to open this project's files.

To set an IDE, change the `.env` file key `DS_PREFERRED_IDE` to one of the supported IDEs.

```shell
DS_PREFERRED_IDE=vscode
```

Supported IDEs:

<style>
    td::before { display: none }
    <!-- @see https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/issues/794 -->
</style>

| **IDE**             |  **Value**  |
|---------------------|-------------|
| PHPStorm            | `phpstorm`    |
| Visual Studio Code  | `vscode`      |
| Remote Visual Studio Code (WSL2) | `vscode_remote`      |
| Sublime             | `sublime`     |
| Atom                | `atom`        |

You might also edit or add a new IDE handler. The IDEs are defined inside the configuration key `ide_handlers` in the configuration file.

#### Docker and VSCode

If you are running Docker and using VSCode, you can configure a new editor handler to properly open files from the Desktop App.

First, open `config/laradumps.php` and add a new entry called `vscode_docker` in the section `ide_handlers`.

You should set the key as follows:

```php
'ide_handlers' => [
       
       //other ides...

        'vscode_docker' => [
            'handler'        => 'vscode://file/',
            'line_separator' => ':',
            'remote_path'    => '/Users/jamesbond/Projects/save-the-queen-app', //<============ Path on my machine host
            'work_dir'       => '/var/www/html'  //<============ Path inside Docker
        ],
    ],
 ```
 
 Now, configure your `.env` to use the handler you have just created:
 
 ```shell
DS_APP_HOST=host.docker.internal
DS_APP_PORT=9191
# other settings...
DS_PREFERRED_IDE=vscode_docker #<============ 
```

#### Remote VSCode (WSL2)

Additional configuration is required for the  `Visual Studio Code WSL2`.

1‚Ä§ You must set the preferred Linux distro in your project's `.env` file (by default: `Ubuntu20.04LTS`):

```shell
DS_PREFERRED_WSL_DISTRO=Ubuntu20.04LTS
```

> üìù **Note**: To get your distro name, run the command `wsl -l -v` in your command prompt.

<br/>

2‚Ä§ Next, you must set the `remote_path` key in your project's `.env` file:

The `remote_path` refers to your project's path in WSL.

```shell
DS_REMOTE_PATH=/home/$USER/path-to-your-project
```

> üìù **Note**: To get remote path, you can run the `pwd`  command inside your WSL project folder.

<br/>

3‚Ä§ Finally, you must set the `work_dir` key in your project's `.env` file (by default: `/var/www/html`):

```shell
DS_WORKDIR=/var/www/html
```

<br/>

Here, you can see a full example of how your `.env` file may look like:

```shell
#...
DS_PREFERRED_IDE=vscode_remote
DS_PREFERRED_WSL_DISTRO=Ubuntu
DS_REMOTE_PATH=/home/jamesbond/Projects/save-the-queen-app
DS_WORKDIR=/var/www/html
```

---

## DS Check

By default, the artisan [ds:check](laravel/debug/deploying-to-production) command is checking the config directory, which will always produce an error.

You must specify which directories you would like to be checked. This configuration is set in the key `ci_check.directories`.

```php
'ci_check' => [
    'directories' => [
        base_path('app'), //checks the app/ directory
    ],
    //...
],
```
